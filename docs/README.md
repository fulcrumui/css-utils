# What are fulcrumui CSS Utilities?

>**We are diligently working to get the full documentation for fulcrumui CSS Utilities completed. Please check back occasionally to see when new items are added. Thank you!**

fulcrumui CSS Utilities is a robust, lightweight library that allows you to *leverage* commonly used CSS to apply simple styles and position to elements by simply adding markup. By using fulcrumui CSS Utilities you can focus on writing verbose, clean markup, while reducing CSS redundancies caused by commonly used styles. The fulcrumui CSS Utilities uses single class rules that only ever carry a specificity of 0 2 0, which makes this ideal to use alongside BEM methodology to increase development efficiency and decrease development time.

The fulcrumui CSS Utilities are lightweight and modular. You can either import the whole library, or you can simply import what you need. fulcrumui CSS Utilities leverages the power of Dart Sass, and aims to be fully configurable. We are constantly adding new features to fulcrumui. If there is a feature you are looking for but is not listed in the roadmap, feel free to let us know what you would like to see added!
