Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities is a robust, lightweight library that allows you to *leverage* commonly used CSS to apply simple styles and position to elements by simply adding markup. By using Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities you can focus on writing verbose, clean markup, while reducing CSS redundancies caused by commonly used styles. The Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities uses single class rules that only ever carry a specificity of 0 2 0, which makes this ideal to use alongside BEM methodology to increase development efficiency and decrease development time.

The Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities are lightweight and modular. You can either import the whole library, or you can simply import what you need. Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities leverages the power of Dart Sass, and aims to be fully configurable. We are constantly adding new features to Fulcrum UI. If there is a feature you are looking for but is not listed in the roadmap, feel free to let us know what you would like to see added!
