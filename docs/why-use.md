# Why you should use Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities

## Keep your stylesheets DRY

The Fulcrum UI CSS Utility library aims to help you reduce the common and reusable styles from your CSS. This is accomplished by allowing you to simply add a class name to your markup, and take advantage of the CSS that already exists within the Fulcrum UI Utility library. Some examples of this would be maringing, padding, and much more! This means you don't have to come up with a class name for an element just to add some margining. It also means that you don't have to duplicate common page rhythm spacing in multiple stylesheets.

## Keep your markup readable

The class names used by the Fulcrum UI CSS Utility library were made verbose by design. This allows you to use terms that you would use in your CSS to apply to your markup. For this reason, when you are going through your markup it is _very easy_ to see the styles that are being applied through the Fulcrum UI CSS Utility classes.

## Page rhythm continutiy ðŸ˜Ž

Easily group common elements between the different pages of your app by 'setting and forgetting' your page rhythm in your config. Using the [Keyword Sizes Module](keyword-sizes.md), you can set your common spacing by keyword and use those all over your page. This promotes standardizing spacing on different pages to make the pages easier to parse through. If you have the same spacing between sections throughout your application, the user's comprehension of your content is increased by allowing them to scan a page witout having to get used to a different page rhythm.

## Approachable for all skill levels

The Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities are also approachable to those with differing levels of CSS knowledge. From the ability to include the full, preconfigured, precompiled sheet for those not comfortable with CSS to include specific modules and configuring them to fit your needs for CSS experts, there is an implementation for everyone!

## Rapid Development ðŸš€

Due to the reasons listed above, the Fulcrum UI CSS Utilities promotes extremely rapid development. Reducing the need to recreate common styles and jump between markup and stylesheets means that you can see your app as you write your markup. Using Fulcrum UI's CSS Utility class names also allows for a reduced barrier to entry when new engineers are introduced to the project.
